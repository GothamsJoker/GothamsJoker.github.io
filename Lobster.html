<h1 id="header8">Lobster is delicious! </h1>
<p>Lobster reminds me of my home. Fresh lobster is a great treat and is abundant up North
    in the United States. I used to take trips to Maine to eat as much as possible.
    Most people have their lobster served with butter and lemon juice but I only need
    the steamed lobster to enjoy a tasty meal!</p>
